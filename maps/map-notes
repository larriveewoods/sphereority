This document outlines the formatting of map files.  
Please note: one based indexing to represent each map unit.  For example, number of wall units surrounding the top of map should equal the number of x units declared.

Formatting of game maps are as follows:

(number of x units) (number of y units)
(map data with x number of columns and y number of rows)
