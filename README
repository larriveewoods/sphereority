Sphereority: Superiority over Spheres
=====================================

Open-source top-down shooter based on Babo Violent 2.

There is a client application and a server application to allow several players to play the game over a network.


SERVER
======

To compile the server:
$ javac server/SphereorityServer.java

Optionally, you may need to compile the server with -Xlint:unchecked:
$ javac -Xlint:unchecked server/SphereorityServer.java


To run the server:
$ java server/SphereorityServer


OPTIONS:
You can specify the server logger level with an optional logger level parameter:
$ java server/SphereorityServer FINEST



CLIENT
======

To compile the client application:
$ javac client/Sphereority.java

To run the client application:
$ java client/Sphereority


OPTIONS:
You can specify the server logger level with an optional logger level parameter:
$ java client/Sphereority INFO

If you want to see the frame rate, you can add the optional -fps flag.
$ java client/Sphereority -fps

You can specify to run a client as a bot with an optional -debug flag.  Note
that if you want to sepcify a logger level you must do that before using this flag.
$ java client/Sphereority -debug

If you want to run a client without a window, add the "-nowindow" flag. It will
display a small confirmation dialog that shows the name the bot uses and will stop
the bot when dismissed. Note that if you specify the -nowindow flag without
specifying the -debug flag, you will get a window anyway.
$ java client/Sphereority -debug -nowindow
