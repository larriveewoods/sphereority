MAP NOTES
---------
This document outlines the format of game map files.

Please note:
one based indexing to represent each map unit.  For example, number of wall units surrounding the top of map should equal the number of x units declared.

The game map is set up as follows:

- Define the with and height of the map
- Define the map boundary and inner walls with '+'
- Specify "spawn points" with 's'

(number of x units) (number of y units)
(map data with x number of columns and y number of rows)

Example map below:
