Optimizations made during development:

common/Stone.java:	Because they don't move, we're now saving the bounding rectangle instead of throwing it away each time.
		This has sped the game up noticeably.
client/GameEngine.java:	Instead of checking all actors against all other actors, we're now only checking stones against player and bullets against players and stones, but not amongst themselves.
		This has sped things up a little bit more.
