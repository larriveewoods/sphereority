Optimizations made during development:

12 November 2008
----------------
common/Stone.java:
	Because they don't move, we're now saving the bounding rectangle instead of throwing it away each time.
	This has sped the game up noticeably.

13 November 2008
----------------
client/GameEngine.java:
	Instead of checking all actors against all other actors, we're now only checking stones against player and bullets against players and stones, but not amongst themselves.
	This has sped things up a little bit more.

14 November 2008
----------------
client/GameEngine.java:
	Instead of checking players against Stones, now we're taking the player's current location into account and comparing the position directly against the map.
	Not much of a _noticeable_ speedup, but logicistly it's probably the most effective, especially for large maps.
